          Snakes are presumed to be one of the deadliest living creature on our
          planet earth.<br />
          But is that actually true?<br />
          The world believe that this are cold-blooded animals and should be
          executed upon first sight which is the main agenda for this
          website.<br />

        <h1><u><b>About the website</b></u></h1>
        <p class="block-column">
            The website mainly entails facts about specific snakes which have different attributes.<br>
            The main agenda for the website is to teach people why we should preserve some snake species because they have re-written their history.

            <br>Now I think we are ready to begin...

      <img class="type1" src="/images/brahminy_blind_snake.jpg" alt="parthenogenetic_snake">
      <p class="description">The type of snake indicated above is known as <i>brahminy blind snake.
        This type of snake is special because it is <strong><em>parthenogenetic.</em></strong><br> Basically you are wondering what this means.. 
        To save you from almost popping your mind because of thinking I will illustrate to you what it means. I t simply means that this species can reproduce without mating.The snake only lays its eggs for about three to four weeks and then they hatch.<br>
        Fun fact;the Brahminy hatchlings grow and are identical to their parent eventhough no gamets were involved in their formation...Quite interesting.

      <p class="naming"><em><b><i>Pit vipers.</i></b></em>As the name suggests this are one of the venomous snakes living.With a duration of less than six hour it's venom can send you to the ground (death). 
      They have a special feature which are the pits in their mouths hense are sensitive to infared radiation of their prey,<br>This feature enables them to sense their prey using their radiation heat hence they are able to hunt during the night no matter how blurry their vision is.<br>It is probally better to walk with a torch light during the night incase you encounter these vicious and ruthless species.</p>
