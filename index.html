          Snakes are presumed to be one of the deadliest living creature on our
          planet earth.<br />
          But is that actually true?<br />
          The world believe that this are cold-blooded animals and should be
          executed upon first sight which is the main agenda for this
          website.<br />

        <p class="block-column">
            The website mainly entails facts about specific snakes which have different attributes.<br>
            The main agenda for the website is to teach people why we should preserve some snake species because they have re-written their history.

      <p class="description">The type of snake indicated above is known as <i>brahminy blind snake.
        This type of snake is special because it is <strong><em>parthenogenetic.</em></strong><br> Basically you are wondering what this means.. 
        To save you from almost popping your mind because of thinking I will illustrate to you what it means. I t simply means that this species can reproduce without mating.The snake only lays its eggs for about three to four weeks and then they hatch.<br>
        Fun fact;the Brahminy hatchlings grow and are identical to their parent eventhough no gamets were involved in their formation...Quite interesting.

      <p class="identification">The stunning exquisite animal beside is known as <i><em>Chrysopelea.</em></i> They are also famously known as (flying snake).Yes that is correct,this small snakes are able to glide in the air and fly for upto about 100 feet.They are also arboreal hence making their habitat to be in trees.You better watch out next time you climb a tree otherwise you will be an unexpected visitor.An interesting part of their nature is that they are non-venomous and swallow their prey whole despite their small length.</p>
